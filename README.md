## Project Summary

The task was to implement two features:

1. Calculate the total number of times each word has been tweeted.

2. Calculate the median number of *unique* words per tweet, and update this median as tweets come in. 

For this coding challenge, I write two simple programs in order to implement these two features. 

Both programs are placed in a directory named `src`. The first program `words_tweeted.py` outputs the results of first feature to a text file named `ft1.txt` in a directory named `tweet_output`. 

The second program `median_unique.py` outputs the results of first feature to a text file named `ft2.txt` in a directory named `tweet_output`. 

Both programs take input tweet file named `tweets.txt` from a directory named `tweet_input`. A shell script named `run.sh` is also given in the main directory, that compiles and runs the programs. 

My solution does require two libraries from the python standard library:

1. sys

2. collections
